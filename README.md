This project was made taking in consideration the following requirements in classes:
## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

* This quiz was inspired by my never ending love of the Harry Potter franchise.

* When the user press Start Quiz Button 5 questions will quiz the user and match their answer with the correct answers and the timer start running decreasing from 60 seconds.

* User will get corresponding feedback for each answer, whether correct or incorrect.

* User will ultimately earn enough points to defeat the Dark Lord for each right answer, or be defeated losing 5 seconds for every wrong answer. If the time ends before the user answer all the questions, It will display an alert showing that the time is over and he will lose.

* With only about a month of JavaScript under my belt at the time, this became a massive undertaking, and a huge victory when I conquered it. Finding the solution involved a lot of googling, trial and error, and many many console logs for each tiny step of the process.
